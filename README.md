## About me 🇨🇦
I'm a teenage developer based in Canada, hoping to eventually work as a developer of some sort. I am trying to broaden my horizons when it comes to programming, meaning I want to be familiar with all sorts of types of programming. "**Full stack**" when it comes to computers in general, if you will.

## What's going on?
Between work, school, and family events these are the things I am currently doing.

- ## Currently learning 📖
  At the moment I am currently learning the following programming languages:
  ```yml
  # 🦀
  Rust:    Learning because of high-level syntax with low-level language performance

  # ⚙️
  C-sharp: Learning on and off because of its compatability with Unity, also for comparison between it and Java which have similar syntax
  ```

- ## Current projects 💾
  Unfortunately for a section like this I cannot keep it up-to-date too frequently, so don't expect 100% accuracy!
